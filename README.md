The **RRRRRRRR stack** is an end-to-end framework for building web applications.

It provides a set of components covering the client-side browser code from the top to the hosting platform at the bottom.

These are the eight default technologies that make up the stack, but other technologies with names beginning with the letter "R" can be swapped in or added.
